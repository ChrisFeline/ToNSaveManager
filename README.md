> ## Why is the .exe so big? >100MB
> The exe is bundled with the .NET runtime that it's required to run the program. Using a command line argument for dotnet publishing: `--self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true` <br>
> This adds size to the file, but ensures that the program runs independently without relying on a previous .NET installation.
>
> This is so people that download this program does not have to go download the .NET runtime framework themselves. And it's ready to run without any extra actions from the user.
>
> The program is compiled from the source using Github actions, you can see the full arguments in [the workflow file](https://github.com/ChrisFeline/ToNSaveManager/blob/a0d503b02fe25fde1b36ca9807756f1830c8e7a8/.github/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml#L46C45-L46C45).


> ## Is this against VRChats ToS?
> - **Short Answer:** No
>
> This is an external tool that uses local plain text files that VRChat writes to the Local APPDATA folder.
> We are allowed to read these files since it does not modify or alter the game in any way.
> **This is not a mod or a cheat.**
