# 🌐 How to contribute with translations?
> > **NOTE**: You can test your language file as you work by dragging the `.json` file into the **Language** box in the **Settings** window.
> - Fork clone the [localization](https://github.com/ChrisFeline/ToNSaveManager/tree/localization) branch.
> - Create a copy of the `en-US.json` language file into `/Localization/Language`
> - Rename it to your local ISO language name. For example `ja-JP.json`
> - Translate the strings contained within this file into your target language.
> 	* Keep important string replacement tokens like: `{0}`, `{1}` or `$$MAIN.SETTINGS$$` etc...
> - Create a pull request.
> 	* Do **NOT** create a pull request into the `main` branch.
> 	* Make sure the only edited file is the new added language `.json` file, any other contribution in the source code unrelated to this translation will be rejected.
